#Core Game Idea

Antarctic Snow Cruiser is central hub for non linear mission system.
Upgrade guns there, track progress (attaining ressources worth a certain dollar amount?)
You can go outside of the cruiser.

Missions itself based around gathering ressources in the antarctic and 
fighting soviets.
